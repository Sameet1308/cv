To investigate the query status sent by MicroStrategy to the database, first check the MicroStrategy Job Monitor to identify the running job and note the associated SQL. Then, using database monitoring tools (like Oracle’s V$SESSION or SQL Server’s Activity Monitor), locate the session or job matching the MicroStrategy database user and SQL. This allows you to determine if the query is actively running, waiting, or blocked. With the session or job ID obtained, the database team can analyze the query’s execution status, identify any issues (like locking or resource waits), and take appropriate action to ensure the query runs successfully or address any performance problems.
