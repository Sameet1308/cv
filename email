I hope this email finds you well. Below is an update and plan regarding the Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL environments and associated timelines for testing and report repointing:
	1.	Dev Environment:
	•	The connection to the dev environment has already been established, and we have successfully completed sanity testing. SQL queries were executed to validate data availability and accuracy.
	2.	Testdb Environment:
	•	We have received the credentials for the testdb environment and plan to complete the connection setup and initial high-level data testing in YIP.
	•	However, the dependent team has confirmed that the data in the testdb environment will only be available by the end of December. As such, high-level testing can only begin after the data is made available.
	3.	Report Repointing (SOV and RCSR):
	•	The complete repointing of the SOV and RCSR dashboards from Oracle to Amazon Aurora will take place in MicroStrategy’s lower environment (Dev).
	•	This repointing will commence in 25 A1, A2, and A3 sprints, with each dashboard requiring two iterations for the complete repointing and unit testing process.

To summarize:
	•	The dev environment testing is complete.
	•	The testdb environment connection will be established in YIP, and high-level data testing will follow once the data is available at the end of December.
	•	The SOV and RCSR dashboard repointing in MicroStrategy’s lower environment will begin in 25 A1, A2, and A3 sprints, with two iterations required for each dashboard.
