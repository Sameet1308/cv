**Subject: Urgent: Inconsistent Intelligent Cube Publishing Across Development Nodes**

Hi [Admin Team/Specific Admin's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I’m reaching out because we’ve run into a significant issue in our development environment that's impacting our work with MicroStrategy Web. Specifically, we're experiencing inconsistent behavior regarding the publication status of intelligent cubes.

**The problem we're seeing:**
- When some users try to create a dossier, they receive a message saying, "Please publish cube," even though the cube is already published.
- Interestingly, other users don’t have this problem and can create dossiers without any issues.

**Details:**
- **Environment:** Development
- **Nodes:** Two (Node 1: `http://node1-url/microstrategy`, Node 2: `http://node2-url/microstrategy`)
- **Symptoms:** The issue seems to depend on which node the user’s session hits via the load balancer.

**What we’ve tried so far:**
- Clearing browser cache and cookies
- Logging out and back in
- Verifying that the cube is published in MicroStrategy Developer

**Possible causes and suggestions:**
1. **Load Balancer Configuration:**
   - It might be a session persistence issue. Could you check if sticky sessions are enabled to keep users on the same node during their session?

2. **Synchronization Issues:**
   - It’s possible that the intelligent cubes are not fully synchronized across both nodes. A republish of the cube and clearing caches on both nodes might help.

3. **Node-Specific Issues:**
   - We should test creating a dossier by directly accessing each node’s URL to see if the issue is isolated to a specific node.

**Next Steps:**
- I suggest we start by testing each node directly to pinpoint where the problem might be.
- Reviewing and synchronizing configurations across both nodes to ensure they’re identical.
- Restarting the MicroStrategy Web services on both nodes to clear any potential cache or session issues.

This issue is impacting our ability to proceed with our development work, so I’d appreciate it if we could prioritize this. Let me know if you need any additional information or if there’s anything I can do to assist.

Thanks for your help!
