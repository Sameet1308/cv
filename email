Here is a carefully crafted response addressing the questions with appropriate logic and historical context provided:

1. Did you review the Oracle Fact table to determine if it was a good match for the MicroStrategy reporting need?

Yes, we reviewed the Oracle fact table extensively and confirmed that it was aligned with the MicroStrategy reporting needs. The fact table was at the right level of granularity for the reporting requirements. The core challenge lay not in the design of the fact table itself but in the need for additional business-approved transformations to make the data ready for consumption in MicroStrategy dashboards. These transformations caused performance issues when executed directly in MicroStrategy, necessitating a different approach.

2. Was the right type of Fact table being used? Was it a Transaction Fact, a Snapshot Fact, or an Accumulating Fact?

The fact table used was appropriate for the reporting requirements. It was designed and approved by the business for use in Cognos and later reused for MicroStrategy. No changes were made to the type or structure of the fact table, as it already fulfilled the reporting granularity and data requirements. The issue arose due to the additional transformations required on top of this base table.

3. Was the Fact table at the right grain for the reporting need?

Yes, the fact table was at the correct grain for the reporting need. The additional transformations required were business-driven and essential for deriving actionable insights. These transformations were necessary to prepare the data for reporting and visualization in MicroStrategy dashboards.

4. Did you essentially create another Fact table when you landed the data in S3 and Databricks?

Yes, we created a transformed fact table in S3. The base Oracle fact table was used as the source, and all the necessary transformations were performed in Databricks using Spark SQL. The transformed data was then stored in S3 and cataloged in AWS Glue. This transformed table was used for reporting in MicroStrategy, ensuring better performance and scalability.

5. Could another Oracle Fact table have produced similar improvements in performance without the additional technical debt of S3 and Databricks?

No, creating another Oracle fact table would not have produced similar performance improvements due to inherent limitations of the on-prem Oracle setup. The Oracle environment lacked the scalability and resources needed to handle the additional transformations efficiently. Moving to the cloud allowed us to leverage Databricks’ Spark engine for distributed computing and S3 for cost-effective storage. While both approaches would have incurred costs, the cloud-based solution was architecturally and operationally more viable, especially given our transition from on-prem to the cloud.

6. Were you trying to demonstrate a cloud replacement for Oracle? If so, then the use of S3 makes sense. Or were you trying to improve MicroStrategy performance?

The primary objective was to address performance issues in MicroStrategy reporting caused by the additional transformations applied on top of the Oracle fact table. While we were not explicitly replacing Oracle, the move to Databricks and S3 was in alignment with our overall cloud migration strategy. The approach not only resolved the performance bottlenecks but also demonstrated the scalability and flexibility of cloud-based solutions.

7. Is there some inherent performance improvement for S3/Databricks data warehousing as compared to Oracle?

Yes, there are several inherent performance improvements with S3 and Databricks as compared to Oracle:
	•	Scalability: Databricks, powered by the Spark engine, allows distributed processing across multiple nodes. This massively parallel processing architecture can handle large datasets much faster than traditional Oracle setups, which are limited by on-prem hardware constraints.
	•	Elasticity: Cloud resources can be scaled up or down based on workload demands, ensuring optimal performance without over-provisioning hardware.
	•	Cost-effectiveness: S3 offers highly durable and low-cost storage for large datasets, and Databricks provides efficient compute options without requiring significant upfront infrastructure investments.
	•	Advanced Processing Capabilities: Spark SQL supports in-memory computation, resulting in faster query execution times compared to Oracle SQL, especially for iterative processing or transformations.
	•	Integration: The seamless integration between S3, Glue, and Databricks simplifies the ETL process and reduces the complexity of maintaining a separate on-prem infrastructure.
	•	Optimized Storage Formats: Using Parquet files in S3 ensures efficient storage and faster querying due to columnar data organization and built-in compression.

In conclusion, these cloud-native features provided significant performance gains and flexibility, making Databricks and S3 the ideal choice for this use case.
