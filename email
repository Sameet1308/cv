5. Could another Oracle Fact table have produced similar improvements in performance without the additional technical debt of S3 and Databricks?

It is difficult to definitively state whether creating another Oracle materialized view (MV) or fact table would have produced similar performance improvements, as this was not extensively tested. While creating an MV in Oracle might have reduced some of the transformation overhead, there were several resource constraints and limitations with the on-prem Oracle setup:
	•	Physical Space Requirements: Creating an MV or a new fact table in Oracle would have required additional physical storage space on the Oracle server. Given the on-prem setup, this could have resulted in higher costs and operational challenges due to limited hardware resources.
	•	Scalability Constraints: The on-prem Oracle infrastructure lacked the flexibility to scale dynamically for handling additional workloads, making it less suitable for the transformation-heavy requirements of the use case.
	•	Cost Implications: Expanding the on-prem resources for Oracle (e.g., additional storage or compute capacity) would have incurred substantial costs, both in terms of infrastructure and ongoing maintenance. By contrast, the cloud-based solution provided a more cost-effective, scalable alternative.

Given these constraints, leveraging Databricks and S3 allowed us to not only address the performance issues but also align with the broader organizational strategy to migrate to the cloud. This approach provided inherent benefits such as distributed processing, scalability, and reduced dependency on limited on-prem resources.
